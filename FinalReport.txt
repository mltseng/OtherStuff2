Final Report

1. Explain how the effective bandwith is calculated:

    The effective bandwith is calculated as the number of bytes being worked on in a job divided by 
	the time it takes for the job to run in seconds. 

2. How much faster than the initial code is this version?
	
   The naive implementation averaged 3.3ms for a job but the stride implementation averaged 2.1ms per 
   job.
